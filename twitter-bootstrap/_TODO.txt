* report feature request/patch to jquery.tweet.js https://raw.github.com/frozzare/jquery.tweet.js/master/dist/jquery.tweet.js

blogofile(_blog) core
=====================
* consolidate tweetbox into a single component, so we could just simply enable/disable it in the config
* same for disqus
* default blog is missing the base.css
* if bf.config.blog.googleanlytics_id should also be included in an if statement, like disqus
* ability to overwrite the title with current page's title - bug in old blog as well
* get a proper title for the archive_index (the menu highlight isn't the most visible)
* create reuse template for post title & categories, potentially move it to python code
* inconsistent use of post.permalink & post.permapath -  which one should be used?
* smells - blog, disqus, tweets, etc. are scattered all over the templates. This makes it very hard to change/extend any of the templates without fully rewriting it. Would be nice to have some similar extensibility mechanism as django has it (block, block.super)
* integrate with blogofile
    * how can we set up a test suite for it (sample blog posts, so at least contentwise things are correctly generated)
    * how can we ensure it will be compatible with future versions going forward?
    * (and how do we update it with future bootstrap releases)

bf-bootstrap
============
* add ico/* which is missing from the bootstrap thing
* disable copying of twitter-bootstrap/blogofile-blog dirs to _site
* update index.html text with regards to customization points
* add pagination using http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#pagination
* header.mako nav_class - needed in sidebar.mako too and somewhat duplicated in blog/chronological.mako
* duplication in chronological/archive_index in laying out the rows/cols
* this hero based first blog post page is kinda nice, but we may want to reserve that for only the index page and not the chronological pages, since this way the first page will not have a filled excerpts below it
