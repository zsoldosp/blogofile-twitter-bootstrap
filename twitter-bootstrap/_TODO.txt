* add ico/* which is missing from the bootstrap thing
* report feature request/patch to jquery.tweet.js https://raw.github.com/frozzare/jquery.tweet.js/master/dist/jquery.tweet.js
* consolidate tweetbox into a single component, so we could just simply enable/disable it in the config
* same for disqus
* make sure we re-add google analytics
* disable copying of twitter-bootstrap/blogofile-blog dirs to _site
* default blog is missing the base.css
* if bf.config.blog.googleanlytics_id should also be included in an if statement, like disqus
* update index.html text with regards to customization points
* move the sidebar to the bottom (and maybe to the right like in the original blog template)
* add pagination using http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#pagination
* might want to use breadcrums - http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#breadcrumbs
* http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#thumbnails
* ability to overwrite the title with current page's title - bug in old blog as well
* get a proper title for the archive_index
* header.mako nav_class - needed in sidebar.mako too and somewhat duplicated in blog/chronological.mako
* duplication in chronological/archive_index in laying out the rows/cols
* inconsistent use of post.permalink & post.permapath -  which one should be used?
* create reuse template for post title & categories, potentially move it to python code
* this hero based first blog post page is kinda nice, but we may want to reserve that for only the index page and not the chronological pages, since this way the first page will not have a filled excerpts below it
---- smells ----
blog, disqus, tweets, etc. are scattered all over the templates. This makes it very hard to change/extend any of the templates without fully rewriting it. Would be nice to have some similar extensibility mechanism as django has it (block, block.super)
