* add ico/* which is missing from the bootstrap thing
* report feature request/patch to jquery.tweet.js https://raw.github.com/frozzare/jquery.tweet.js/master/dist/jquery.tweet.js
* consolidate tweetbox into a single component, so we could just simply enable/disable it in the config
* same for disqus
* make sure we re-add google analytics
* disable copying of twitter-bootstrap/blogofile-blog dirs to _site
* default blog is missing the base.css
* if bf.config.blog.googleanlytics_id should also be included in an if statement, like disqus
* update index.html text with regards to customization points
* move the sidebar to the bottom (and maybe to the right like in the original blog template)
---- smells ----
blog, disqus, tweets, etc. are scattered all over the templates. This makes it very hard to change/extend any of the templates without fully rewriting it. Would be nice to have some similar extensibility mechanism as django has it (block, block.super)
