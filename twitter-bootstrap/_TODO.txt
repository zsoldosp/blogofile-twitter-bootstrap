* jquery.tweet.js https://raw.github.com/frozzare/jquery.tweet.js/master/dist/jquery.tweet.js - request enabling of custom templating

blogofile(_blog) core
=====================

Non-minor enhancements/New features
-----------------------------------

* css optimization/automation

    * minify css for each page - create css pages based on md5sum of the content of all the included css files
    * autotimestamping css/js components in the templates? configure css/js in the config? <style src="abc.css?x=<build started timestamp/uuid>">
    * just have a helper method that can be used in the templates - bf.helper.include_css(*css_files)

* adding warnings/checks to the build pipeline

    * enforce draft folder - warn if a post is draft but not in the draft folder and also warn if in the draft folder and not draft
    * warn if there is a TODO left in the post (escapable)

* create reusable widgets that can be configured/enabled in the config file, so we don't have to edit 
  multiple templates in the default blog tempalte to change it to our liking

    * examples are: tweetbox, disqus, google analytics 
    * always included within an if widget.enabled if block
    * enabling re-templating existing widgets (e.g.: include tweetbox in the sidebar <ul>, but also for comments maybe)
* bring django templates to blogofile
* enhance / reuse site settings - e.g.:

    * include comments in the sidebar of the blog
    * prefix site title with page title
    * include custom javascript/css in a given page/template (e.g.: post)

Bugfixes/minor modifications 
----------------------------

* inconsistent use of post.permalink & post.permapath in blogofile_blog templates -  which one should be used?
* navigation (header.mako) - use links ending with / -> extra, unneeded redirect on each request - link pragprog/nygard article
* default blog is missing the base.css
* blog excerpts - get rid of lxml dependency & use BeautifulSoup (easy to use on windows)
* improve failure diagnostics

    * ability (command switch?) to run mako._CompileContext with strict_undefined = True
    * template used more than once warning - have a foo.html and a foo.html.mako, and you get a misleading error message

Questions
---------

* how to disable archive and write a full post map only with titles? quasi-pagemap
* integration with blogofile - blogofile.contrib.* & tests

    * discoverability/user friendly - I personally would prefer the blogofile.contrib project being hosted together with the core

        => but who is the target end user?

    * testing 
        even creating a custom blog template can be difficult 
        ensure that all blog templates meet a minimum level
        approval test - just diff the template against the prior one (ignore timestamps)
    * keeping up to date with parent changes

blogofile-twitter-bootstrap
===========================
* get a proper title for the archive_index (the menu highlight isn't the most visible)
* set up notifications so that we know when bootstrap is updated
* add ico/* which is missing from the bootstrap thing
* disable copying of twitter-bootstrap/blogofile-blog dirs to _site
* update index.html text with regards to customization points
* add pagination using http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#pagination
* should sidebar.mako's latest posts use the same 'active' for the current post?
* this hero based first blog post page is kinda nice, but we may want to reserve that for only the index page and not the chronological pages, since this way the first page will not have a filled excerpts below it
* for the future - image thumbnails http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#thumbnails
